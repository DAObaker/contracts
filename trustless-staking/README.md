# DAO Baker

**_Self amending DAO for staking economy_**
> An upgradeable, onchain staking validator for Tezos community earning staking rewards while retaining custody of funds, with added features for effortless peer-to-peer participation and automation of the entire baking process and governance voting by Block Swap.

Note: this is an evolving experiment  as a proof of concept - do not use it as is.
This Standard Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Baker framework is written in Michelson to run on the Tezos blockchain.

## What is DAO Baker?

DAO Baker is an earnest effort by **[Block Swap](https://blockswap.xyz)** to decentralize the **Tezos (XTZ) staking (a.k.a baking)** process through a set of self-enforcing smart contracts and provide block by block transparency and auditability, thus minimizing reliance on centralized discretionary staking providers.

The purpose is to address the user experience and inefficiency plaguing the current staking process that limits the benefit only to niche technical crypto users. Our solution intends to provide a mainstream grade user experience for Tezos staking.
DAO Baker is a 100% open source project.
