# DAO Baker

**_Self-amending DAO for Staking Economy_**
> An upgradeable, on-chain staking validator for the Tezos community earning staking rewards. Additional features include peer-to-peer participation and automation of the entire baking process and governance voting.

Note: this is an evolving experiment and a proof of concept.
This standard Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) Baker is written in Michelson and runs on the Tezos blockchain.

## Motivation 

DAO Baker is an earnest effort by **[Block Swap](https://blockswap.xyz)** to decentralise the **Tezos (XTZ) staking (aka baking)** process through a set of self-enforcing smart contracts. This provides block by block transparency and auditability, thus minimising reliance on centralised discretionary staking providers.

The purpose is to address the user experience and inefficiency plaguing the current staking process that limits the benefit  to niche technical crypto users. Our solution intends to provide a mainstream user experience for Tezos staking.
DAO Baker is a 100% open source project.

# Project Overview

<img align="center" width="auto" src="https://i.ibb.co/SV17fLz/Staking-Economy-n.png">


DAO Baker architecture **_discards the concept of a single entity as a validator entirely for an on-chain smart contract._** Therefore, staking validators no longer specify the reward rate nor control the reward distribution when accepting delegation. Instead, users merely delegate the funds to a staking **SLOT** address and DAO Baker automates the rest including in-protocol reward distribution. Users receive a fungible token for the supplied asset as a tokenised stake representation so that the user can withdraw the asset at any time by burning the token.

The whole process takes place on-chain. Hence, this is a very simple but very different from the traditional staking validator that we are used to.

**Key Components of Stake Management:** ðŸ‘‡

  
## Vault - Account Management   

The current implementation of the **Vault** works as follows:

Allows users to make **_deposits and stake XTZ by simply sending XTZ to the contract_**, and the contract will automate the account generation and rewards allocation to that address. Account addresses are counterfactual based on the initial user deposit key and can be safely deployed by anyone using the vault contract. A user can make withdrawals partially or completely. When withdrawn completely, the user automatically redeems and transfers the account balance XTZ to the originated address. A user may cancel the delegation at any time should they wish and withdraw their balance with accumulated rewards.

There is also an account recovery **Escape Hatch** option built-in. This can be used in the event that a user has lost access to their account or the contract has been compromised. Additional features will be rolled out incrementally for the vault module, such as the ability to receive custom periodical payouts and portfolio management features.


## SLOT - Stake Management   

SLOTS act as a way of assembling batches for asset flow within the stake market. Records of the state of SLOTS distribution map updates every 256 blocks.

SLOTS keep a permanent record of every batch that ever took place so you can determine who sent what to who, and how their account balances have changed. The result of this process is recorded as an on-chain commit hash of what happened on the stake distribution network.

> SLOTS are batches of delegations with an ID on the blockchain, and the delegations are users lending token balances from one address to another.
 

<p>
<img align="right" width="350" src="https://i.ibb.co/ZJk01pr/Slot-Architecture.png"> 
We implement the arbitrary concept of baking SLOTS for modular stake management that is in line with the core protocol. SLOTS represent a set of XTZ delegated to a SLOT ID (key) that is ensured by a bond lender aka SLOT Owner. SLOTS hold 8,000 XTZ, the same as a ROLL in the core consensus staking process; SLOTS are an abstraction of a ROLL in the Tezos core protocol.
</p>

<p>
Value of a slot token will vary on staking market dynamics: 

> (Total number of delegations it represent + Rewards collected from Protocol ) * Efficiency rate]
</p>

## Token Faucet   

The staking market should support multiple SLOT owners by using a SLOT token to track each SLOT share of the market. The FAUCET allows anyone to mint a custom SLOT token. Similarly, a token will be issued for a deposited userâ€™s stake. The tokens has the right to withdraw the underlying balance and rewards. This provides staking liquidity and allows staked tokens to be traded.


Zero risk delegations (aka delegation tokens) can represent the sum of delegations distributed on multiple SLOTS within a single address.
Risk bearing delegations (aka SLOT tokens) for bond lenders are tokens with an added earning and a variable token value subject to the delegations represented.





## Contract details ðŸ‘‡
#### [See deployed contract here](https://carthagenet.tzstats.com/KT1J7VKG2JubhZKczCdktQGRhcieTRHbvJfa)

| Key Functions|  Description |
| --- | --- |
|  `deposit` | Allows the user to **deposit XTZ** (multiples of 1 XTZ) to the contract account. In the case of new users, the contract will automatically generate and assign an account for them.|
| `withdrawal` | Allows the user to **withdraw XTZ** at any time by using the contract withdrawal function (multiples of 1 XTZ). In case of performing a _complete withdrawal_, the account will get closed.|
| `close_account` | Handles the **final settlement** of the account and also gets triggered in the event of a complete withdrawal of XTZ from the account.|
| `distribute` | Handles the **payout of staking rewards** to designated accounts and also handles final settlement on account closing events. |
| `slot` | Handles the **creation of a new slot**. Once a person transfer sufficient amount of tez with this entrypoint as argument and a baker address, the slot contract will be created which delegates their tez to the specified baker. |
